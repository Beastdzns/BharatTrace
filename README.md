# Xion Hackron - CLINKIT

## Solution Overview

Our solution, **CLINKIT**, is a comprehensive logistics and inventory management system that leverages cutting-edge technology to optimize sales, reduce waste, and enhance efficiency. This system is designed to offer dynamic solutions for managing product inventory, crew schedules, and carbon footprints, making it the perfect tool for businesses seeking to streamline their logistics operations.

### 1. Expiry-Based Dynamic Discounting  
We have implemented a set of mathematical algorithms that dynamically adjust discounts based on product expiry dates. By doing so, we optimize sales and minimize waste, ensuring that products nearing expiration are sold off quickly at a discount. This solution not only boosts sales but also improves sustainability by reducing product wastage.

### 2. Cargo Truck, Crew, and Carbon Footprint Management  
This part of the system is designed to manage cargo truck operations, optimize crew scheduling, and track the carbon footprints of logistics activities. By ensuring that operations are efficient, we contribute to eco-friendly logistics practices while maintaining a balance between cost efficiency and environmental responsibility.

### 3. NFC-Based Model Implementation  
Weâ€™ve integrated **NFC (Near Field Communication)** technology to seamlessly track products, authenticate transactions, and transfer real-time data in logistics and inventory management. This technology enables smooth data exchange and real-time tracking of product movement, ensuring that all actions are securely logged and monitored.

### 4. Interactive Inventory Management & Calculations  
Using interactive maps and advanced algorithms, we provide real-time inventory tracking. Our platform helps businesses make informed decisions regarding product stocks, placements, and logistics, ensuring that the supply chain remains efficient and responsive to dynamic changes.

## Formulas Used

The mathematical formulas used in the system help optimize inventory management, carbon footprint calculations, and dynamic discounting. Below are the main formulas implemented:

### 1. **Dynamic Discounting Formula**  
The discount rate \(D\) is calculated based on the number of days until a product expires, as follows:

\[
D = \frac{E - t}{E} \times \text{Base Discount Rate}
\]![Screenshot 2025-03-06 070219](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05510b3e-41fa-4234-93e5-fc5b2ced3ed6)

- \(E\) = Expiry date of the product.
- \(t\) = Current time.
- \(D\) = Discount to be applied.

### 2. **Carbon Footprint Formula**  
Carbon emissions per truck are calculated using:

\[
C = \frac{T \times F}{D}
\]

Where:
- \(C\) = Carbon footprint (in kg).
- \(T\) = Total distance travelled (in km).
- \(F\) = Fuel consumption rate (in liters per km).
- \(D\) = Fuel density (in kg per liter).

### 3. **Inventory Optimization Formula**  
We use a variant of the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) formula to optimize inventory:

\[
EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
\]

Where:
- \(D\) = Demand rate (units per period).
- \(S\) = Ordering cost per order.
- \(H\) = Holding cost per unit per period.
